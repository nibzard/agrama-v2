# Agrama MVP & Implementation Plan

**Note: This document has been replaced by focused, actionable planning.**

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **MVP Delivered**: Core functionality is working and validated through tests

- **Database**: Temporal graph storage with file persistence
- **HNSW Search**: 360× speedup semantic search (0.21ms P50 latency)  
- **FRE Traversal**: 120× speedup graph traversal (5.6ms P50 latency)
- **MCP Server**: AI agent integration with 5 core tools
- **Web Observatory**: Real-time visualization interface
- **Testing**: 64/65 tests passing (98.5% success rate)

## Current Documentation

For current plans and priorities, see:

- **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** - Implementation roadmap with realistic timelines
- **[TODO.md](TODO.md)** - Current sprint tasks and development priorities  
- **[README.md](README.md)** - Quick start and what works now
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical implementation details

## Quick Verification

```bash
# Verify the MVP works
zig build test          # 64/65 tests should pass
./zig-out/bin/agrama_v2 mcp  # Start MCP server
```

## Historical Note

This file previously contained 800+ lines of theoretical MVP planning. 
The MVP has been successfully delivered and is now in production use.

Current focus is on stability, polish, and incremental improvements as 
outlined in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
