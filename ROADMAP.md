## Implementation Principles

### Quality First
- All features must pass comprehensive tests
- Performance regressions are blockers
- Security considerations in every feature
- Documentation updated with every change

### Incremental Delivery
- Ship working features early and often
- Validate with real users before major investments
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Prioritize user feedback over theoretical features

### Sustainable Development
- Maintain high code quality standards
- Avoid technical debt accumulation
- Focus on maintainable, understandable code
- Regular refactoring and cleanup

## Contributing

### Development Workflow
1. Pick a task from current phase priorities
2. Ensure `zig build test` passes before starting
3. Implement feature with comprehensive tests
4. Validate performance impact with benchmarks
5. Update documentation as needed

### Code Standards
- Follow existing Zig patterns and conventions
- Use memory-safe practices with proper cleanup
- Add tests for all new functionality
- Benchmark performance-critical changes

### Community
