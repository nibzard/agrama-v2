2. **MCP â†’ Frontend**: MCP Specialist provides WebSocket APIs for Observatory interface
3. **Algorithm â†’ Database**: Perf Engineer provides optimized algorithms to Core Engineer
4. **Any â†’ QA**: All implementations go through QA Engineer before completion
5. **Any â†’ Tasks Master**: All work updates go through Tasks Master for tracking

### Conflict Resolution

1. **Technical Disputes**: Escalate to human developer for architectural decisions
2. **Priority Conflicts**: Tasks Master has final say on task priorities
3. **Resource Conflicts**: QA Engineer mediates code quality vs. performance trade-offs
4. **Scope Creep**: Refer to SPECS.md and MVP.md for authoritative requirements

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Subagents

- **Automatic**: Subagents are invoked automatically based on task types
- **Explicit**: Use `@subagent-name` to invoke specific expertise
- **Proactive**: Tasks Master monitors and coordinates all development work

### Examples

```bash
# Explicit subagent invocation
"@db-engineer implement the TemporalGraphDB init function"
"@mcp-specialist add the read_code MCP tool"
"@frontend-engineer create the knowledge graph visualization component"
"@perf-engineer optimize the HNSW search performance"
"@qa-engineer set up integration tests for the database"
"@task-master update TODO.md with current progress and next priorities"

# Tasks Master automatically coordinates after any significant work
# QA Engineer automatically reviews after code changes
# Perf Engineer automatically checks performance-critical changes
```

### Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each subagent focuses on their area of expertise
2. **Clear Handoffs**: Explicit communication when passing work between subagents  
3. **Documentation**: All subagents reference and update relevant documentation
4. **Quality First**: Never compromise on code quality for speed
5. **Performance Awareness**: Always consider performance implications
6. **Test-Driven**: Write tests early and often
