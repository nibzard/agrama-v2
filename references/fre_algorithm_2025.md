## Abstract

We give a deterministic O(m log^(2/3)n)-time algorithm for single-source shortest paths (SSSP) on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights. This is the first result to break Dijkstra's O(m + n log n) time bound for this fundamental graph problem.

## Key Technical Contributions

### Algorithmic Innovation
- **Time Complexity:** O(m log^(2/3) n) 
- **Graph Type:** Directed graphs with non-negative real edge weights
- **Computational Model:** Comparison-addition operations
- **Deterministic:** No randomization required
- **Breakthrough:** First algorithm to break the "sorting barrier" for SSSP

### Comparison with Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Dijkstra:** O(m + n log n) time complexity
- **FRE (This Paper):** O(m log^(2/3) n) time complexity
- **Improvement:** Significant for dense graphs where m >> n

### Implementation Considerations
- Uses advanced data structures for frontier management
- Requires careful implementation to achieve theoretical bounds
- Particularly effective on graphs with high edge-to-vertex ratios

## Relevance to Agrama Project

### Current Integration Status
The Agrama project implements the Frontier Reduction Engine (FRE) based on this paper's algorithm to achieve superior graph traversal performance in temporal knowledge graphs.

### Performance Targets
- **Target Speedup:** 5-50Ã— improvement over traditional Dijkstra implementation
- **Use Cases:** Dependency analysis, impact assessment, semantic discovery
- **Graph Scale:** Optimized for knowledge graphs with 100K+ entities
