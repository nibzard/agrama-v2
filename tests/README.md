# Enhanced MCP Server Testing Infrastructure

Comprehensive testing suite for the enhanced MCP server implementation with advanced database integration.

## Test Categories

### 1. Functional Tests (`enhanced_mcp_tests.zig`)
Comprehensive validation of all enhanced MCP tools and protocol compliance.

**Test Areas:**
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: JSON-RPC 2.0 structure, tool discovery, error handling, request validation
- **Enhanced Tool Functionality**: read_code_enhanced, write_code_enhanced, semantic_search, analyze_dependencies, database_stats, legacy compatibility
- **Database Integration**: HNSW, FRE, CRDT, triple hybrid search, temporal queries
- **Multi-agent Collaboration**: Concurrent access, CRDT conflict resolution, event broadcasting, agent isolation

**Run Commands:**
```bash
# Individual tool tests
zig build test-enhanced-mcp

# With verbose output
zig build test-enhanced-mcp -- --verbose
```

### 2. Performance Tests (`enhanced_mcp_performance_tests.zig`)
Validates performance targets and algorithmic guarantees.

**Performance Targets:**
- Semantic Search: O(log n) HNSW lookup in <50ms
- Dependency Analysis: O(m log^(2/3) n) FRE traversal in <75ms  
- MCP Tool Response: <100ms P50 response time
- Concurrent Agents: 100+ simultaneous agents
- Throughput: >500 operations/second

**Test Areas:**
- Individual tool performance benchmarking
- Scalability validation (O(log n) for HNSW, O(m log^(2/3) n) for FRE)
- Concurrent agent load testing
- Throughput and latency regression testing
- Memory efficiency validation

**Run Commands:**
```bash
# Full performance suite
zig build test-enhanced-mcp-performance

# Quick performance test (reduced iterations)
zig build test-enhanced-mcp-performance -- --quick

# Performance with specific dataset size
zig build test-enhanced-mcp-performance -- --dataset 1000
```

### 3. Security Tests (`enhanced_mcp_security_tests.zig`)
Validates security, memory safety, and robustness.

**Security Areas:**
- **Memory Safety**: Leak detection, bounds checking, use-after-free protection, double-free prevention
- **Input Validation**: Malformed JSON, injection prevention, path traversal, special characters
- **Access Control**: Agent isolation, unauthorized tool access, privilege escalation
- **Concurrency Safety**: Race conditions, deadlock prevention, data races
- **Resource Limits**: Memory exhaustion, CPU exhaustion, DOS prevention
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling, information leakage prevention
- **Fuzz Testing**: Random input fuzzing, mutation-based fuzzing

**Run Commands:**
```bash
# Full security suite
zig build test-enhanced-mcp-security

# Security with custom fuzz iterations
zig build test-enhanced-mcp-security -- --fuzz 200

# Memory safety focus
zig build test-enhanced-mcp-security -- --memory-only
```

2. **Run memory safety tests** during development
3. **Validate performance targets** before commits
4. **Security scan** before releases

### Test Maintenance
- Regular baseline updates for performance tests
- Security vulnerability pattern updates
- Test data freshness validation
- CI/CD pipeline optimization

## Contributing to Tests
