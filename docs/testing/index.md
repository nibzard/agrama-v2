## Testing Philosophy

### Quality-First Development

Agrama follows a **test-driven quality assurance** approach:

- **Prevention over Detection**: Comprehensive testing prevents bugs from reaching production
- **Performance as a Feature**: Every component must meet performance targets
- **Memory Safety**: Zero-tolerance policy for memory-related issues
- **Real-World Validation**: Tests simulate actual AI collaboration scenarios
- **Continuous Quality**: Integrated testing in every development workflow

### Production Readiness Standards

All code must pass rigorous validation:

::: info Quality Gates
- **90%+ test coverage** for core functionality
- **Zero memory leaks** detected by debug allocators  
- **All performance targets met** through benchmark validation
- **Security scan clean** with no critical vulnerabilities
- **Concurrency safety** validated through stress testing

## Test Execution Workflows

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Core development loop (mandatory after every change)
zig fmt .          # Format code
zig build          # Verify compilation
zig build test     # Run comprehensive tests

# Extended validation
zig build test-all              # Full test infrastructure
zig build test-primitives       # Primitive-specific validation
zig build test-enhanced-mcp     # MCP server testing
zig build test-concurrent       # Concurrency stress tests
zig build test-fuzz            # Security fuzzing
```

### Continuous Integration

   ```

### Writing Your First Test

Follow the established patterns:

```zig
test "your_component_specific_functionality" {
    // Setup with proper memory management
    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(testing.allocator);
    defer arena.deinit();
    const allocator = arena.allocator();
    
    // Initialize test context
    var context = try TestContext.init(allocator);
    defer context.deinit();
    
    // Execute operation under test
    const result = try context.performOperation(test_input);
    
    // Validate expected outcomes
    try testing.expect(result.success);
    try testing.expectEqual(expected_value, result.value);
}
```
