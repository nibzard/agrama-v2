## Performance Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Performance Fixes (3 months)

**P0 - Hybrid Query Optimization**
- Target: Reduce P50 latency from 163ms to <10ms (16× improvement needed)
- Approach: Algorithm optimization, query planning, index efficiency
- Expected Impact: Enable production-ready hybrid search capabilities

**P0 - FRE Graph Traversal Optimization**  
- Target: Reduce P50 latency from 5.7-43.2ms to <5ms (1.1-8.6× improvement needed)
- Approach: Implementation efficiency, memory layout optimization, algorithmic refinements
- Expected Impact: Meet theoretical FRE performance promises

### Phase 2: Scale and Polish (6 months)

**P1 - Primitive Performance Validation**
- Target: <1ms P50 latency for STORE, RETRIEVE, LINK primitives  
- Target: <5ms P50 latency for SEARCH, TRANSFORM primitives
- Approach: Complete primitive implementation and optimization

**P2 - Multi-Agent Scaling**
- Target: Support 100+ concurrent agents without performance degradation
- Current: Unknown (not yet measured)
- Approach: Concurrency testing and optimization

### Performance Monitoring

**Benchmark Coverage**:
- ✅ Core Database Operations - Comprehensive
- ✅ HNSW Vector Search - Comprehensive  
- ⚠️ FRE Graph Traversal - Partial (needs optimization focus)
- ❌ Hybrid Query Engine - Needs dedicated optimization
- ❌ Primitive Operations - Implementation pending
- ❌ Multi-Agent Concurrency - Testing framework needed

## Realistic Performance Claims

Based on actual measurements, Agrama currently delivers:

### Validated Performance (Production Ready)
- **MCP Server Tools**: <1ms response times (392× better than 100ms target)
- **Database Storage**: 8,372 QPS at 0.11ms P50 latency  
- **HNSW Vector Search**: 0.21ms P50 latency with 5× margin
- **System Stability**: 98.5% test pass rate, reliable build system

### Performance Issues (Requires Optimization)
- **Hybrid Queries**: 163ms P50 (16× too slow) - major optimization needed
- **Graph Traversal**: 5.7-43.2ms P50 (1.1-8.6× too slow) - efficiency improvements needed

### Theoretical Claims Needing Validation
- **100-1000× HNSW speedup**: Partially validated (360× measured on limited dataset)
- **5-50× FRE speedup**: Not yet achieved (currently slower than targets)  
- **Sub-10ms hybrid queries**: Not achieved (currently 163ms)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and test (98.5% pass rate)
zig build
zig build test

# Start MCP server (high performance)
./zig-out/bin/agrama_v2 mcp

# Run comprehensive benchmarks
zig build bench-quick
```

## Development Priority

1. **Fix performance regressions in hybrid query engine** (P0 - 16× improvement needed)
2. **Optimize FRE graph traversal implementation** (P0 - up to 8.6× improvement needed) 
3. **Complete primitive implementation and validation** (P1 - architecture foundation)
4. **Scale testing to larger datasets and concurrent users** (P2 - production readiness)

The system has a solid foundation with excellent performance in storage and MCP operations, but needs focused optimization work on the complex query and graph traversal algorithms to meet the ambitious performance targets.
